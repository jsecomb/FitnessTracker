## Description: 

Full-stack fitness tracker App built with node.js utilizing MongoDB. The App allows the user to view, create and track daily workouts. The user inputs the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise and adds that exercise to a given workout (a workout represents all the exercises done on a day). A stats page shows charts that break down the exercises done each day by duration and total pounds lifted (for resistance exercises). There is also a button that allows the user to clear the database.
